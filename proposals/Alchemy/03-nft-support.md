# RFC-03: NFT Support

## User Story

### Current
Alchemy currently lacks the ability to display, transfer, create and sell NFTs (ERC721s and ERC1151).

### New 
As an artist, I want to collaborate with other artists and create/sell NFT art on OpenSea (to share profit) with a storefront or through bundling.   
As an organisation, I want to award NFTs (badges/awards).   
As a user, I want to be able to see what NFTs a DAO owns and use them to create a revenue model.  

## Impact on Adoption
This would allow large brands to run promos using DAOs that issue NFTs. It could also serve as a bridge to on-board the large community of NFT enthusiasts / artists on platforms such as OpenSea.

## Roadmap
| Time | Workload | Description |  
|-|-|-|  
| 2 weeks | 1.0 FT | Adds a basic view to the Alchemy DAO dashboard for viewing owned NFTs (with basic metadata support for images). Adds transfer support through new nft support scheme that is accessed either through the scheme create proposal menu or through the new view.  |  
| 3 weeks | 1.0 FT | Adds a view for deployed NFTs that displays basic information and allows the creation of new tokens and the updating of their metadata using the new creation scheme. |  
| 2 weeks | 1.0 FT | Polish previous additions with feedback rounds. Adds built in support for 3rd party sellers (mintbase/opensea). Adds special support for certain tokens such as ENS. |  

## Detailed Design

This proposal outlines how with the addition of 2 new generic schemes, users will be able to add NFT functionality to their DAOs.

#### 1 - NFT Support Scheme

##### Functionality
- Gives DAOs the ability to transfer NFTs (whitelisted NFTs are selectable from drop-down, with optional manual override for unwhitelisted tokens)
- Gives DAOs the ability to list owned tokens for sale on OpenSea and accept existing orders (in Eth or ERC20s)
- Gives DAOs the ability to whitelist NFTs (The front end will be aware of whitelisted NFTs)

##### Architecture
- The NFT Support generic scheme needs to be created
- The NFT view needs to be created to show owned NFTs
    - Query metadata (image, name, sale status, owned status, etc...)
    - Updates on whitelisted NFT transfers
    - Custom views for special NFTs (eg. ENS)
- The NFT Support proposal forms need to be created
    - Whitelisting
    - Transfering
    - Sale listing
    - Offer handling
    - Updating metadata (for DAO owned NFTs)

#### 2 - NFT Creation Scheme:

##### Functionality
- Gives DAOs the ability to deploy new NFT Contracts
- Gives DAOs the ability to create new NFTs from these contracts
    - The created NFTs can be transfered
    - The created NFTs can be listed for sale on OpenSea (in Eth or ERC20s)
    - The created NFTs can have their metadata updated

##### Architecture
- The NFT Creation generic scheme needs to be created
- The generic NFT contracts that will be deployed by this scheme need to be created
- The Created NFT view needs to be created to show created NFT contracts
    - Query metadata (image, name, count, etc...)
- The NFT creation proposal forms need to be created
    - Deploying new NFT contracts
    - Minting new NFTs from existing NFT contracts
    - Sale handling
    - Offer handling
    - Updating metadata 

## Open Questions
- Which token standards should be supported?
- Are there "super" NFT contracts where single contract addresses are used for multiple NFTs.
- Are there many NFTs that fail to follow the token standards?
- Where will created NFT metadata be stored?
- Which contract model should be used for the NFT Creation Scheme (NFT specific contract, DAO specific NFT contract, or a super generic NFT contract used by all DAOs)
