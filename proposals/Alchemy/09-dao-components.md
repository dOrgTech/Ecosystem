# RFC-09: DAOcomponents

## User Story

As a small team developing a widely used protocol (DeversiFi, Bancor, Orchid, Totle, Compound), I am considering to use DAOstack to transition protocol governance to users and major stakeholders.

As the administrator of a large hackathon, meetup, or events community (Odyssey, ETHGlobal, FestDAO, Crypto Mondays, Bitcoin Malaysia, 1 Mil Devs), I am considering to use DAOstack to transition community governance to members.

I want my users to interact with the DAO from within my website or app instead of sending them to Alchemy so that I control the end-to-end user experience.

### Current
Use [Client library](https://github.com/daostack/client) directly.
TODO: describe process of integrating.. big learning curve to get started, need to repeat boilerplate all over,..

### New 
Add 2 components to my React app...
TODO explain further...
Seamless developer experience due to reduced boilerplate, rerendering, dependencies and improved traceability and context-awareness.

## Impact on Adoption

- Horizontally scale the stack by making it an order of magnitude easier to interact with from other frontends

- Generate buzz & attract major crypto protocols to use DAOstack by showing how they can integrate it into their existing frontends with a few lines of code
