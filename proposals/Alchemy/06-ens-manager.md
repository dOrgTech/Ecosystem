# RFC-00: Template

## User Story

### Current

DAOs do not have an easy way to...
- add all needed generic schemes to manage an ENS domain (ENS Public Resolver, ENS Registry, ENS Registrar)
- see all ENS domains owned by the DAO
- purchase a new ENS domain on behalf of the DAO

### New

Users will have access to a new tab in Alchemy called "ENS" which serves as an "ENS Dashboard" for the DAO. Here they'll be able to:
- add all ENS generic schemes
- see all ENS domains owned by the DAO
- propose a domain purchase to the DAO
- propose to edit a domain the DAO owns

## Impact on Adoption

Currently governing something as important as a domain is left up to administrative single user accounts. Allowing DAOs to govern this is a huge advantage to the space and will certainly draw a lot of attention.

## Detailed Design

  We want to interact with the ENS contracts, so the DAO can registrer/edit/renew it's domains by interacting with the ENS contracts.
