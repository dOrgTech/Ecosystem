# Genesis Recurring Funding Proposal

> $15k per month x 6 months (Q4 2019 & Q1 2020)

# Summary

dOrg is the first team to emerge from the Genesis community and begin decentralizing the development of the DAO Stack. After a successful period of incubation, it was [recently announced](https://daotalk.org/t/on-the-importance-of-community-oversight-shifting-dorg-s-funding-to-genesis/896) that DAOstack will cease funding dOrg and direct this extra monthly funding to Genesis. We have been discussing this transition for a long time, and are excited to finally take the plunge!

With this proposal, we are officially asking Genesis to fund our ongoing software development and open-source advocacy efforts in the DAOstack ecosystem / GEN economy. This proposal will:

1. Signal Genesis DAO's intent to fund dOrg for the attached deliverables at a rate of $15k/month for 6 months (Q4 2019 & Q1 2020)
2. Send dOrg payment for the first period (Oct 1 - Oct 31). [See progress report here](Genesis_Milestone_01.md).

# Past Work

We have published all of dOrg's milestone reports from our incubation period with DAOstack [[1](DAOstack_Milestone_01.md)][[2](DAOstack_Milestone_02.md)][[3](DAOstack_Milestone_03.md)]. Here are some highlights:

- Constructed a [DAO creator](https://dorg.tech/#/dao-creator) application for the simple deployment of DAOstack native DAOs.
- Developed a [fundraising module]((https://github.com/dOrgTech/BC-DAO/blob/master/README.md)) that allow DAOs to [automatically distribute dividends to its token purchasers](https://www.notion.so/dorg/BC-DAPP-Proposal-9c4dec4870ed48a19b39f5be6ccbf373#93f5e757c3b74a5bbe5748702594de62).
- Pioneered a DAO [legal solution](https://coindesk.com/dorg-founders-have-created-the-first-limited-liability-dao) and migrated all company funds and decision-making authority to our DAO.
- Developed an [easy to use React Component Library](https://github.com/dOrgTech/DAOcomponents) to support DAOstack DAO app integration.
- Partnered with GoodDollar to build a DAOstack-based [identity solution](https://github.com/dOrgTech/id-dao).
- Made numerous open-source contributions to core DAOstack repositories.
- Helped developers and other external teams get started building on DAOstack.

# Deliverables

### Timeline

- 6 months
- Oct 1, 2019 – March 31, 2020

### Accountability

For each initiative, we are dividing up the deliverables across the two halves of the six month period: Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. We will also link each monthly payment proposal to a new progress report in [this directory](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ecosystem/tree/master/DAOstack). This reporting structure will keep dOrg accountable to Genesis while avoiding unnecessary bureaucratic overhead.
