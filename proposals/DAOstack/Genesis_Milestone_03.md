*An overview of dOrg's progress in the 3rd month (Dec 1 - 31) of our six month engagement with Genesis DAO.*

*For context, [see the recurring proposal here](Genesis_Recurring_Funding.md).*

# DAOcreator

- **DAOcreator in Alchemy**: We've embedded the first version of the UI in Alchemy. The [PR](https://github.com/daostack/alchemy/pull/1264) is currently awaiting approval from DAOstack core.

- **DAOcreator Redesign**: Development is underway, and a usable beta is coming soon. You can test an early WIP version [here](https://daocreator-v2.herokuapp.com/). Please send any and all feedback to *contact@dorg.tech*.
  - Progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/orgs/dOrgTech/projects/10).

  </p>

- **DAOcreator Packages Published**: Packages for both the core logic and V1 UI have been published to NPM. This will allow any developer to either embed the UI within their applications, or easily build their own UI and have 80% of the work done for them by the core library.
  - [DAOcreator Core Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dorgtech/daocreator-lib)
  - [DAOcreator V1 UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dorgtech/daocreator-ui-v1)

### Next Steps 

- Finish V2 UI, progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/orgs/dOrgTech/projects/10).

- Get newly deployed DAOs on Alchemy front-page. [Solution proposed here](https://github.com/daostack/alchemy/issues/1246).
