# dOrg Ecosystem

[dOrg](https://dorg.tech) is a web3 freelancer coalition. We join forces to enjoy economies of scale while maintaining our independence as freelancers.

See our [Handbook](TODO) to learn all about the organization.

## Contribute

The easiest way to join dOrg is to complete an open bounty. If the DAO accepts your bounty, you will receive up to the full rewardâ€“ along with membership in the DAO and the ability to contribute to our ongoing workstreams.

See the `Issues` section of the repository for all open bounties.

### Suggest a new bounty

Anyone can suggest a new bounty by adding an issue to this repo.

Bounties can then be discussed and priced according to their priority, complexity and required time. Bounties are funded by the DAO through a proposal of intent. Links to these passed proposals will be added to each bounty.
